---

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Penn State, with a focus on security in federated learning. My research explores emerging threats in distributed machine learning, with an emphasis on backdoor injection, threat modeling, and stealthy attack removal. My latest work involves developing a framework for the controlled and stealthy removal of persistent backdoors, challenging existing assumptions in federated learning threat models.

In the past, Ihave worked on IoT security, smart contract analysis, and blockchain security. I am also a Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH v8) through EC-Council.

Alongside research, I have served as a Head TA for graduate and undergraduate courses in system programming, discrete mathematics, and computer/network security. Iâ€™ve designed course materials, debugged student code, and broken down complex systems concepts into clear, accessible explanations. These experiences have given me a strong foundation in both cybersecurity and technical communication.

Over the years, I have developed tools for fuzzing, bug reproduction, and vulnerability detection, and mentored students in low-level C debugging. I enjoy solving real-world problems at the intersection of security, systems, and education.

When I am not immersed in code or research, I love cooking, traveling to new places, watching and playing cricket, and following soccer. These interests keep me grounded, open to new experiences, and constantly curious.
